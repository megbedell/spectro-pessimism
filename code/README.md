2D spectrum generator
=====================

generator.py can be used to simulate a small snippet of a 2D spectrum,
similar to what an Echelle spectrograph would do.

Example Usage
-------------
See "__main__" section of generator.py for an example.

Use ```python setup.py build_ext --inplace``` to compile cython code for a ~10x speedup.
